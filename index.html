    <br>It was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of 
    <br>certain death had actually given him life. While everyone around him was 
    <br>in tears and upset, he actually felt more at ease. The doctor said it 
    <br>would be less than a year. That gave him a year to live, something he'd 
    <br>failed to do with his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life 
    <br>until then.</p>
